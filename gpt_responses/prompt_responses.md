What happens when promises are broken,
In JavaScript, a bug has awoken.
The code may not fulfill its fate,
But fear not, for a hint awaits.

Riddle hint:
When chaining promises, don't forget,
To return the next promise set.

Here is an example of a common but complicated memory leak in Python:

```python
# Creating a memory leak by not properly de-referencing objects

class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

# Creating a linked list with a memory leak
head = Node(1)
current = head

for i in range(2, 1000000):
    current.next = Node(i)
    current = current.next

# This linked list will consume a lot of memory as the objects are not properly de-referenced
```

Memory leaks can occur when objects are not properly de-referenced, leading to a buildup of unused memory that is not being released back to the system. In this example, a linked list is created without properly de-referencing the nodes, causing a memory leak as each node continues to reference the next node without being released.

In a forest of nodes, a tree so grand,
To delete a node, you must understand.
Traverse left and right, with care and might,
Until the node to delete is in sight.

But beware, dear coder, of a tricky plight,
A bug may lurk in the dead of night.
Check for the smallest child, oh so sly,
For it may hold the key to your reply.

In Python code, let your logic flow,
Delete the node, but beware the woe.
For in the depths of this binary tree,
A bug may hide, waiting to flee.

So test your code, with caution and grace,
And conquer the bug that hides its face.
Delete the node, with errors few,
And may your code be forever true. 

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, key):
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        self.val = key

def deleteNode(root, key):
    if root is None:
        return root

    if key < root.val:
        root.left = deleteNode(root.left, key)
    elif key > root.val:
        root.right = deleteNode(root.right, key)
    else:
        if root.left is None:
            temp = root.right
            root = None
            return temp
        elif root.right is None:
            temp = root.left
            root = None
            return temp

        temp = minValueNode(root.right)
        root.val = temp.val
        root.right = deleteNode(root.right, temp.val)

    return root

def minValueNode(node):
    current = node

    while current.left is not None:
        current = current.left

    return current

# Create a binary search tree
root = Node(50)
root.left = Node(30)
root.right = Node(70)
root.left.left = Node(20)
root.left.right = Node(40)
root.right.left = Node(60)
root.right.right = Node(80)

deleteNode(root, 30)
```

Sure! Here is an example program in Python that demonstrates how to use yield and generators:

```python
def fibonacci_generator(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    count = 0
    while count < n:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b
        count += 1

# Using the fibonacci_generator to generate the first 10 Fibonacci numbers
fib_sequence = fibonacci_generator(10)
for num in fib_sequence:
    print(num)
```

Output:
```
0
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
21
34
```

In this program, the `fibonacci_generator` function is a generator that yields the Fibonacci sequence up to the specified number `n`. The `yield` keyword is used to return values one by one without terminating the function. When the generator is called using a loop, it generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the given number.
